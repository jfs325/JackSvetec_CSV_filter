# How-To
1. Copy the repository and load the project directory into an IDE
2. use 'go run main.go' to start the program

## Assumptions
1. The CSV file is manually created in the main function with rows with matching First Names, Last Names, and DOBs 
2. If the user is entering their DOB, I check to make sure their input is in an integer, but I assume they will not put 0s for year, day, or month
3. User can make their names lowercase or uppercase and the solution will still find the appopriate match if it exists
